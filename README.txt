This is a simple blog layout I created using HTML5 and SASS. The entirety of the site is coded with SASS and output as CSS3 with the exception of the background being an image created in Photoshop.  I had to difficulty creating this site since it was basically my first run-through solo using SASS and Compass.app. I hit a few road bumps along the way but I had help from good friends and Google to get me through. 

The Menu and the Recent Posts have a simple hover state at the moment. I would like to change up the font and the layout a little more. I would also like to add in a search bar above the menu and footer below the content.
